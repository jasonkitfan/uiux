The redesign of the HD page is driven by four key aspects to enhance the user experience, ensure mobile responsiveness, streamline the application process, and provide clear information and requirements.

The redesigned HD page will offer a seamless navigation experience, enabling applicants to effortlessly locate relevant information and complete their applications efficiently. Emphasis is placed on simplifying the application process and providing clear instructions and guidance at each step.

Secondly, mobile responsiveness is a paramount consideration in the redesign effort. Recognizing the prevalence of mobile devices for website access, the HD page will be fully optimized and responsive across various screen sizes. Applicants will enjoy a consistent and convenient experience, regardless of the device they use to access the application website.

Thirdly, the redesign aims to streamline the application process, minimizing complexity and improving efficiency. This involves reducing the number of steps required, simplifying form filling, and automating certain processes where applicable. By doing so, applicants will experience a smoother and more user-friendly application journey, saving them valuable time and effort.

Lastly, the redesigned HD page recognizes the importance of providing clear and comprehensive information to applicants. It will present program details, admission requirements, and application deadlines in a concise and easily understandable manner. By offering transparent and easily accessible information, the redesigned page enables applicants to assess their eligibility and make informed decisions with ease.

In summary, the redesigned HD page is centered on enhancing the user experience, ensuring mobile responsiveness, streamlining the application process, and providing clear information and requirements. By addressing these four aspects, the redesign aims to create an application website that is intuitive, user-friendly, efficient, and informative, ultimately improving the overall experience for applicants seeking to pursue HD programs.
